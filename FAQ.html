    <h2>What are the general requirements to participate?</h2>
    <p>To participate in the network, researchers need to commit to select and establish at least one node, survey the node, and provide samples for coordinated analysis. Some previous experience doing research on biocrusts is helpful, but we welcome new researchers to our community. Participants must be able to accurately characterize biocrust communities at their site. This will involve species-level identification in many cases, and the PI team can help link you with resources to achieve that.</p>

    <h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
    <p>If you are interested in participating in CrustNet, please fill out our intake form at  
    <a href="https://qualtrics.nau.edu/jfe/form/SV_0UrXWzHhjPmKRZs" target="_blank">this link</a>. Feel free to contact Sierra Jech at <a href="mailto:sierra.jech@nau.edu">sierra.jech@nau.edu</a> or any member of the PI team with questions. Note: the official call for collaborators has not gone out yet, but it will soon and you are still welcome to submit our intake form if you already know you want to participate.</p>

    <h2>What site characteristics are required for a CrustNet node?</h2>
    <p>We seek nodes in distinct ecoregions that support biocrusts, including drylands, alpine areas, polar areas, and other regions. Nodes should have the following characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Landowners / user’s / agency permission to conduct research can be obtained.</li>
      <li>Substantial biocrust cover - at least 10% across the whole node, with at least some high-cover patches. (Some exceptions may be permissible, please discuss with us).</li>
      <li>Approximately 1 hectare (ha) in size. The area must accommodate a representative 30 m radius circular area, several dozen quadrats (0.25 × 0.25 m to 0.5 × 0.5 m; some permanent if Tier 2), and optional experimental infrastructure such as biocrust transplants or rainfall reduction shelters (if Tier 3). Flat sites are preferred for logistical reasons, but sloping sites may be included.</li>
      <li>For Tier 2 and 3: Return visits must be feasible.</li>
      <li>Sites must be 10 km apart from another node (with a few exceptions if very different surface types co-occur). See <a href="https://crustnet.org/nodes.html" target="_blank">current node map</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Do I need to sample my node at a particular time of year?</h2>
    <p>The timing of sampling is intentionally flexible and depends partly on which CrustNet components are being done. Some best practices are: (1) Tier 1 sampling is best conducted outside of peak annual plant biomass to facilitate better visibility of biocrusts and avoid confusing functional effects of biocrusts and annual plants. and (2) It is advisable to visit sites when dry (in between rain events) to reduce the need to dry soils later and to eliminate soil measurement variability.</p>

    <h2>What is involved in each sampling tier, and what level of time and personnel is required?</h2>
<p>The CrustNet protocol is divided into a tiered system based on effort and commitment. There is a short description here, but please see the Tier Calculator to get a sense of the effort level for each decision.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> One-time survey activities designed to be easy and low-cost.
    <br><em>Effort:</em> 5–6 people, 2 days. One visit.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Establishment of simple, low-cost experiments and repeated monitoring.
    <br><em>Effort:</em> 5-6 people, 3 days. Initial visit plus two additional visits over a three-year period.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Establishment of experimental infrastructure and optional components, requiring greater investment.
    <br><em>Effort:</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Drought component:</em> ½ day, 2 people, two additional visits over three years + ~$1000 in equipment (some cost defrayal may be possible).</li>
      <li><em>Common garden component:</em> Requires coordination with the PI team; not required for all Tier 3 participants.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers conducting Tier 2 and/or Tier 3 components must maintain their site for at least 3 years and be willing to fund the infrastructure and implementation required.</p>


    <h2>How does authorship work?</h2>
    <p>CrustNet authorship is designed to be fair, inclusive, and transparent. Groups contributing Tier 1 data receive co-authorship for two members on the four planned core papers. Additional Tier 2 and Tier 3 contributions lead to co-authorship on further papers. All contributors will be co-authors on a “data paper” compiling the full dataset. Proposals for new manuscripts using CrustNet data must be reviewed by the PI Team to avoid overlap, but participants are always free to publish using data from their own plots.</p>

    <h2>Can I add my own project idea?</h2>
    <p>Yes! Not only can participants use data from their own plots, we are also open to the development of side projects that leverage project data components.</p>

    <h2>What acknowledgement text should be used for CrustNet papers, talks, or other products?</h2>
    <p>This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. 2350456 and 2350457, and by MPG Ranch.</p>
